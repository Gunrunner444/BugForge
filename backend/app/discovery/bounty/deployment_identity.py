"""Deployment and scope identity reconciliation (Phase 51, owner Phase 3).

A contract that exists in a repository is not the contract that is deployed, and a
deployed address may be a proxy that delegates to an implementation that is not the
source under review. This module reconciles what the manifest *claims* about a
deployment (chain id, address, runtime bytecode digest, source commit, compiler)
against what the source *shows* (proxy / beacon / diamond / clone topology), and
reports the binding honestly:

* ``source == deployed`` is never assumed. It is ``yes`` only when a runtime bytecode
  digest is known on both sides and matches, ``no`` when both are known and differ,
  and ``unknown`` otherwise (for example when no compiler is available to produce a
  digest).
* A proxy/beacon/diamond/clone topology makes the behavioural binding *ambiguous*:
  the deployed address runs an implementation the source may not contain.
* An ambiguous binding is never promoted to "confidently in scope". Explicit scope
  inclusion plus an unambiguous binding is required for that.

Nothing here compiles, downloads, or executes. Detection is evidence-based (it needs
a delegatecall and a recognised slot or base, not a bare keyword).
