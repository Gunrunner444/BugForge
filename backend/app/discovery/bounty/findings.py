"""Bounty-quality research findings.

A finding here is a static candidate plus everything a reviewer needs to judge it:
scope, known-issue and duplicate status, the evidence that exists, and what is still
missing. Suppression is a statement about reporting, never about safety: a known
issue is not safe, an out-of-scope asset is not safe, and a duplicate is not safe.
Severity is only ever a candidate drawn from the program's own policy.
