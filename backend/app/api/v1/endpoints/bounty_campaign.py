"""Bounty-campaign API (Phase 51/52).

Exposes the Phase 49 orchestrator, the Phase 50 bounty engines, and the Phase 52
local stateful execution over the existing FastAPI + operator-auth conventions.
Every route requires an authenticated local operator. The AI/Cursor cannot grant
an approval, change scope, raise a budget, mark a finding verified, or submit
anything through these routes.

Expensive campaign work (running the orchestrator, synthesizing and running
harnesses, building the report) never blocks the event loop: it runs on a worker
thread, either through the background-job endpoints or via ``run_in_threadpool``.
